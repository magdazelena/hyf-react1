# What is React?

![React meme](https://i.imgflip.com/2kuh6f.jpg)

React JS is a JavaScript library developed and maintained by Meta (Facebook).

**Here is your new best friend, [the React website and docs](https://react.dev/).**

## Why should you care?

Using React as a library is an industry standard.

# Components

## What are components?

[Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

**Excercise**: Let's componentize!

## No more HTML: introducing JSX

[How to write in JSX](https://react.dev/learn)

### Wait, another programming language...?

Nope. JSX is JavaScript made usable. JSX code is [transpiled](https://babeljs.io/repl) to JavaScript the browser can undestand.

# Create a React app

## What do you need?

1. Access to React library.
2. Ability to write modular JavaScript code.
3. Sensible transpiler to combine the modules AND translate JSX to JS.
4. Some script to run constant checks and transpile the code whenever you make changes.

## How to get started?

Don't reinvent the wheel, type "create react app" into search engine.

[create-react-app docs](https://create-react-app.dev/)

**Excercise**: Create a React app and cleanup the code. You app should be displaying only an `h1` with your name in it.

# Architecture 1.0

## Hierarchy

- parent vs child

## Properties

**Props** for short.
